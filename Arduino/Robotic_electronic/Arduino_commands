This is a list of commands that can be sent to the serial
port of the Arduino.
*Subject to lots of change*

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Set Commands
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. "A_SET_ENGINE (int left_speed) (int right_speed)"

Sets the current speed of both the left and right motors.
If the given values are not in the range of MIN_SPEED to
MAX_SPEED, the speed will be set to the closest limit.


2. "A_SET_CATCH (int catch_position)"
Sets the angle of the catch position for the kicker and
saves it to memory.
*Probably will change as our kicker is slightly 
different*

3. "A_SET_KICK (int kick_position)"
Sets the angle of the kick position for the kicker and
saves it to memory.
*Probably will change as our kicker is slightly 
different*

4. "A_SET_FKICK (int fkick_steps)"
Sets the number of teps the motors will move in the FKICK
run function.

5. "A_SET_GRAB (int grab_angle)"
Sets the angle of the grab position for the kicker and
saves it to memory.
*Probably will change as our kicker is slightly 
different*

6. "A_SET_SHOOT (int shoot_value)"
Sets the step size of how much the robot will rotate with
the run_shoot function

7. "A_SET_TSHOOT (int tshoot_value)"
Currently only saves a value to memory that isn't used.
Probably will be removed

Run Commands

8. "A_RUN_ENGINE (int left_step) (int_right_set)"
Will move both engines a set number of steps as specified
by the arguments. The step values can be negative to run
in the opposite direction. This is the main movement
function

9. "A_RUN_CATCH"
Sets kicker to catch position. This angle is specified in
memory or by the corresponding SET function.

10. "A_RUN_KICK"
Sets kicker to kick position. This angle is specified in
memory or by the corresponding SET function.

11. "A_RUN_FKICK"
Moves the robot forward by the number of steps in the
FKICK memory. For extra force on a kick.

12. "A_RUN_GRAB"
Sets kicker to grab position. This angle is specified in
memory or by the corresponding SET function.

13 "A_RUN_SHOOT (int turn_direction)
Will rotate the robot in the turn direction for the number
of steps specified in memory by the SHOOT_STEP
